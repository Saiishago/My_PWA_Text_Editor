# My_PWA_Text_Editor

In this challenge we had to build a text editor that runs in the browser. It is a one page Application that meets the criteria of PWA. We were provided with Starter Code, which meant all we had to do is populate the _TODOs_ we were given in the specific files.

## Files Populated

```
In the Client folder:
- database.js
- install.js
- src-sw.js
- webpack.config.js
```

## Terminal Commands

```
Run:
- npm run build
- npm run start
```

Those commands will create a Dist folder in the Client folder, once you've ran a successful compilation you can open it in your web broswer [Deployed Application](https://github.com/Saiishago/My_PWA_Text_Editor) and start typing away.
